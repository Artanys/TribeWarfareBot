; This is the main configuration file for TribeWarfareBot.  You will need to edit this file when you setup the bot.
; The bot must be restarted for edits to take effect, but a reload command will be created in the future.
; Currently the bot does not overwrite any settings, but this may change in a future update.


; HOW TO GET VARIOUS IDS:
; http://i.imgur.com/GhKpBMQ.gif
; Enable developer mode (options, settings, appearance), right click the object you want the id of, and click Copy ID
; This works for basically everything you would want the id of (channels and users).  For roles you have to right click a role mention.


[Credentials]
; Put your token here.  Not "secret".  The secret is not the token.
Token = bot_token

[Permissions]
; This number should be your id.  It gives you full permissions.  You do not put the bot's id here.  That's silly.
; If you don't know how to get this, scroll up a bit and read the part that says "HOW TO GET VARIOUS IDS"
; If you can't do that for some reason, join the help server (invite in the readme) and type this in chat: !id
; If you still don't understand, watch this https://streamable.com/4w8e and may your respective deity have mercy on your soul.
; I don't want any more "how do I get the OwnerID" questions.
OwnerID = 000000000000000000

[Chat]
; Change this if you don't want commands to trigger another bot
; Example:
;	CommandPrefix = *
; This means the commands you use in chat are *play, *skip, etc.  This explanation exists because it seems no one knows what "prefix" means.
; You do not list commands here.  You do not put "CommandPrefix = *play *queue *np *skip *clear..." etc.  R e a d i n g   c o m p r e h e n s i o n.
CommandPrefix = !

; Restrict the bot to only listen to certain text channels.  Uncomment (remove the ; at the start of the line) and add channel IDs to enable.
; An id looks like this number: 41771983423143930
; To get a channel id, enable Developer Mode in discord (settings, appearance), right click a channel, and click Copy ID.
; Example: BindToChannels = 41000000000000005 41000000000000007
; (Don't use these ids, they won't work)
; This next line is the one you uncomment to use the option:
;BindToChannels =

[TribeWarfareBot]
; Server IP or domain name to query. You must give the exact server ip/domain. Ex: tribewarefare.apocalypse.gg -or- 158.69.123.5
;ServerIp = 

; Server port to connect with. Ex: 27015
;ServerPort = 

; Specify minimum number of online players from a tribe to allow a raid against that tribe
;MinimumToRaid =

; Only allow whitelisted users to use commands
; Deprecated in favor of permissions
WhiteListCheck = no

; Automatically delete messages the bot sends after some time.
DeleteMessages = yes

; Delete the invoking message when DeleteMessages is enabled.  Does nothing when DeleteMessages is disabled.
; Note the bot must have Manage Messages permission in the channel to delete other messages.
DeleteInvoking = no

; Prints extra output in the console and some errors to chat.
; This option is a work in progress, don't expect much.  You might as well just leave it on for now.
DebugMode = no
